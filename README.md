# earthquakeMaps

I learnt about streaming earthquake data using usgs.gov API a few days ago
and came up with an idea of creating a visualization of earthquakes of a 
certain magnitude in a map with a timeline. But obviously like every idea I ever come up with
it had been done before but this time none other than Google themselves.

Here's the Visualization they have created:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

But hey, what we see there is a static map without labels of the places with a limited zoom capability.
Why not create the visualization that I always wanted to do on a basic map with the labels allowing people to 
zoom as much they desire to and also create good visualizations other libraries of maps API?

Here'e the Library I will be referring:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries

Is this possible? time to find out...

Self set deadline for this project is in a week BTW
